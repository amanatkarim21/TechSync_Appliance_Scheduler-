This project aims to create an advanced database application using SSMS for robust data storage, complemented by Microsoft Access as the front-end interface. The goal is to enhance data handling efficiency and enable effective monitoring of historical changes within the system.

Our project, "Building a Database Application with Microsoft Access and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)," was a collaborative effort that demonstrated our proficiency in database development and management. We utilized Microsoft Access for frontend development and SSMS for backend database design.

In this project, we achieved the following:

Database Schema Design: We meticulously designed a structured database schema using SSMS, creating tables to efficiently store and manage data.

SQL Scripting: With SSMS, we skillfully crafted SQL commands for data manipulation, enabling us to perform operations like inserting, updating, and deleting records with precision.

User-Friendly Interface: We created user-friendly forms and comprehensive reports in Microsoft Access, enhancing the accessibility of our application and simplifying database interaction.

Real-World Application: Our application focused on managing repair appointments for appliances, demonstrating its practical utility.

This project not only enhanced our database design skills but also highlighted the effectiveness of technology in optimizing real-world processes. We look forward to applying these skills to future projects and contributing to the field of data management.
